# R2048

This is a remake of the well known 2048 game I created while learning React. It's a web application, and should therefore run on anything with a decent browser.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/RastislavKish/R2048
cd R2048
npm install
npm start
```

Or, you can use the [live version.][(https://rastislavkish.com/apps/r2048)

On the main game screen, activate the focus mode of your screenreader and focus the board grid. You can navigate using arrow keys and slide tiles using Shift+Arrow keys. Game saves (if prompted) are made into the local cache of your browser, keep in mind they won't persist if you have it auto-cleaned.
